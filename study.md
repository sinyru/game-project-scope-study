## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
    I would use an array to hold all the position of the game and have the user interacts with an eventhandler.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    9 div representing each slot of the game and an array in JS to represent it.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
    First, I will create the html and css file. I will then create the Javascript file, but not as a whole. I will have to test every function that I create one by one. Basically, trials and errors.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    As a user, I want a virus-free game because I don't want people hacking into my computer.
    As a user, I want a lag-free game because I don't like getting stopped.
    As a user, I want a fully instructed game because we all like instructions.
    As a user, I want a fully decorated website because I want to see something that captures my eye.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    By separating into files that contains the neccessarities and only the neccessarities to execute the specified aspect.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
    I would like to have it finished and executable before thinking about adding a creative spin. Trying to run before walking for me in this case will hurt.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
    I would commit oftenly with a clear message attached.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
    If i finish it early, YES!

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
